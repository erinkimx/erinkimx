    <p>I’m a student at Northeastern University majoring in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and minoring in Biology. I am constantly experimenting with new ways to combine my interests in marketing, science, and design.

      In my free time, you can catch me in the dance studio, practicing Chinese characters, or reading a good horror novel.
      
      Feel free to check out my latest work, see where I’ve worked, or connect with me! </p>
