    <p>I’m currently a User Experience Researcher in Digital Marketing at ServiceNow with a background in marketing and design. I’ve dabbled in social media marketing, management consulting, and brand development but find myself most fulfilled when asking questions about how people think and applying those learnings to products. </p>
